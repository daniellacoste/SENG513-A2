# JavaScript Practice
The purpose of this assignment is to practice JavaScript programming.

Within **code.js**, the function getStats(txt) reads textual input and computes statistical information for the given input. The results are as follows:

* __nChars__: the total number of characters in the text, including all whitespaces
* __nWords__: the total number of words in the text
* __nLines__: the number of lines in the text
* __nNonEmptyLines__: the number of lines in the text containing at least one visible character (any non-whitespace character)
* __maxLineLength__: the length of the longest line, including any trailing whitespace except newlines '\n'
* __averageWordLength__: the average word length in the text
* __palindromes__: a list of unique [palindromes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) in the text
* __longestWords__: the 10 longest words in the text - in the case of ties, the secondary sorting criteria is alphabetically sorted
* __mostFrequentWords__: the 10 most frequent words of the text, concatenated with the respective frequencies - again, ties are resolved by alphabetical sorting
